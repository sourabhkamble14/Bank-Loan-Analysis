### Bank Loan Data Analysis and Visualization | SQL & Power BI  

#### **Introduction**  
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a **Bank Loan Dataset**, offering actionable insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower profiles. The dataset provides key metrics for assessing lending performance and portfolio quality.  

---

#### **Dataset**  
The **Bank Loan Dataset** consists of loan-related data in CSV format, covering attributes such as loan ID, issue date, funded amounts, repayments, borrower DTI, and interest rates. The data was processed and stored locally for analysis.

#### **Data Extraction and Storage**  
1. **Data Processing with SQL**:  
   - Used **SQL** to extract, clean, and manipulate raw data from the dataset.  
   - Applied advanced queries and **aggregation functions** to compute total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower DTI.  

2. **Database Design and Storage**:  
   - Structured a **SQL database** to store the processed data.  
   - Organized tables to efficiently handle key metrics like loan amounts, repayments, and borrower details.

#### **Data Visualization**  
1. **Interactive Dashboards in Power BI**:  
   - Imported cleaned data into **Power BI** for detailed visualization.  
   - Used **DAX functions** to calculate key metrics such as:  
     - **Total Loan Applications**  
     - **Total Funded Amount**  
     - **Total Amount Received**  
     - **MoM (Month-over-Month) Changes**  
     - **Average Borrower DTI**  
     - **Average Interest Rate**  

   - Designed interactive dashboards with visual elements, including:  
     - **Line charts** to monitor trends over time.  
     - **Bar charts** to analyze borrower profiles and loan purposes.  
     - **Treemaps** to represent home ownership data.  
     - **Filled maps** to showcase regional lending performance.

#### **Key Insights**  
- **Loan Performance**: Identified trends in loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments.  
- **Borrower Analysis**: Evaluated borrower DTI, interest rates, and repayment behavior for strategic decision-making.  
- **Loan Quality**: Differentiated "Good Loans" vs. "Bad Loans" to assess risks and optimize portfolio health.
